# Open Question & Answer Sessions for All Users

## Learn new tricks and ask & discuss questions

Meet the HPC staff, discuss problems and project ideas, give feedback or
suggestions on how to improve services, and get advice for your
projects.

Join us on [Zoom](https://uit.zoom.us/j/65210601673), get yourself a
coffee or tea and have a chat. It doesn't matter from which institute or
university you are, you are **welcome to join at any time**.

This time we will start with a **short seminar about “How to install software
on Saga, Fram & Betzy as user”**. Afterwards we have the open question and
answer session.

We can talk about:
- Problems/questions regarding the Stallo/Vilje
shutdown and migration
- Questions regarding data storage and management
- Help with programming and software management
- Help with project organization and data management
- Anything else

If you think you might have a challenging question or topics for us,
you can also send them to us before, so we can come prepared and
help you better. If you have general or specific questions about
