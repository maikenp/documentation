# Advanced User Support (AUS)

Advanced User Support offers services to provide specialised and more in-depth
competence to a research group or community.

For service description, applying for AUS and further details, follow the 
documentation [here](https://www.sigma2.no/advanced-user-support).

## Extended Support (formerly known as Mini AUS but not to be confused with AUS)

For a smaller adoptions, optimisations and changes which are exceeding ordinary support, you can ask support staff for extended support (formerly called mini Advanced User Support). Extended support can also be initiated by the support staff, typically if they see that this could be of a relevance, f.ex. in connection with in-effective jobs. In this case you will be contacted by the support staff and offered the Extended Support.

Extended Support projects are not requiring any funding or in-kind from the project or user. The total amount of work effort must not exceed **5 working days**. A likely outcome is that Extended Support could lead to formulation of a proper AUS project, which needs an application and evaluation, but in turn could assign a few months of dedicated work from one of our experts. Again, see the 
documentation [here](https://www.sigma2.no/advanced-user-support).
